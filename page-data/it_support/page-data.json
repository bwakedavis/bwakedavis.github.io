ASCII encoding</p>\n<p><strong>UTF-8</strong> allows us to store a character in more than one byte.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong> A series of steps to solve a particular problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Logic gates</strong> Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.</p>\n<p>Computer Architecture consist of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hardware - physical components</li>\n<li>Operating System - Allows hardware components to connect with the system</li>\n<li>Software Layer - programs</li>\n<li>User - operate, maintain and program</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Hardware</h4>\n<p><strong>Ports</strong> are connection points that we can connect to the devices so that we extend the functionality of our computer.\neg. Power outlet, monitor, mouse, keyboard, ethernet</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CPU(Central Processing Unit)</strong> - the brain of the computer. Does all the calculations and data processing.</li>\n<li><strong>RAM(Random Access Memory)</strong> -temporary memory for the computer.</li>\n<li><strong>Harddrive</strong> - holds all our data, eg music, pictures, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Motherboard</strong> - the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.</li>\n<li>Power supply</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Programs</em> - are instructions that tells the computer what to do.</p>\n<p><em>Transistor</em> send voltage</p>\n<p><em>Registers</em> store the data that our cpu works with.</p>\n<p><em>Memory Controller Chip</em> is a bridge between the CPU and RAM.</p>\n<p><em>EDB(External Data bus)</em></p>\n<p><em>Address bus</em> connects the CPU to the Memory Controller Chip.</p>\n<p><em>Cache</em> allows quicker access of data by the CPU. there are levels of cache:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>L1 is the smallest and the fastest cache</li>\n<li>L2</li>\n<li>L3</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Clock wire</em> lets the cpu know it can start doing calculations.</p>\n<p><em>Clock speed</em> is the maximum number of clock cycles  that a cpu can handle in a certain amount of time</p>\n<p><em>Overclocking</em> refers to the process of increasing the rate of your cpu clock cycles to perform more tasks.</p>\n<p>Types of CPU socket includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Land Grid Array(LGA)</li>\n<li>Pin Grid Array(PGA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Heat Sync</em> is used for cooling</p>\n<p>Types of RAM includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>DRAM(Dynamic Random Access Memory)</em> - when 1 or 0 is send to the DRAM it stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor. This is either a charge or discharge represented by 0 or 1.</li>\n<li>synchronous DRAM memory</li>\n<li>SDRAM</li>\n<li>DDR4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s important to make sure your RAM is compatible with your motherboard.</p>\n<p><em>Characteristics of a motherboard</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chipset  which decide how components talk to each other. ie. North bridge(Interconnect things like RAM and video cards), South bridge(maintain IO devices)</li>\n<li>Expansion slots - gives the ability to increase functionality of our computer.</li>\n<li>Form factor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>System on a chip(SOC)</em> - packs the CPU, RAM and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip. eg on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>A <em>charge cycle</em> is one full charge and discharge.</p>\n<p><em>Peripheral</em> is basically anything that you can connect to your computer externally that adds functionality.’</p>\n<p><em>USB</em> - Universal Serial Port.</p>\n<p><em>MB</em> is megabyte or unit of data storage.</p>\n<p><em>Mb/s</em> is megabit per second which is a unit of data transfer rate.</p>\n<p><em>Display port</em> outputs video and audio.</p>\n<p><em>USB type C</em> transport data and power.</p>\n<p><em>VGA, HDMI, DVI, Display Port</em> can connect a projector to a computer.</p>\n<p><strong>BIOS</strong> - is stored on the motherboard in a readonly memory chip(ROM chip) which is non-volatile.</p>\n<p><em>UEFI(Unified extensible Firmware Interface)</em> is more modern and has better compatibility with than BIOS.</p>\n<p><em>CMOS battery</em> store basic data used when booting a computer.</p>\n<h4>Operating System</h4>\n<p><em>Operating System</em> is the whole package that manages our computer resources and let’s interact with it. consist of user space(Applications), Kernel space(Process, memory, file, I/O managers).</p>\n<h5>File system</h5>\n<p>File handling - file data, file metadata and file system. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>File system include ext4, NTFS</li>\n<li>File data - Block storage improves faster handling of data because data isn’t stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.</li>\n<li>File metadata - owner, permissions, size, date modified, file type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Process management</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Kernel manage resources efficiently..</li>\n<li>Multiple processes run at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them and manages how the processes are terminated.</p>\n<h5>Memory management</h5>\n<p>Memory is managed efficiently.</p>\n<p><em>Virtual memory</em> is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that act like memory that our processes can use.</p>\n<h5>I/O management</h5>\n<p>The kernel manage IO devices by loading drivers that are used, transfer data in and out , how the devices talk to each other.</p>\n<p><em>Shell</em> is a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.</p>\n<p><em>Logs</em> are files that record system events on our computer, just like a system’s diary.</p>\n<p><em>SSH(Secure Shell)</em> is a protocol implemented by other programs to securely access one computer from another. You can use SSH client or server.</p>\n<p><em>Virtual Private Network(VPN)</em> allows you to connect to a private network over the internet.</p>\n<h4>Networking</h4>\n<p>A <em>network</em> is an interconnection of computers.</p>\n<p><em>Internet</em> is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world.</p>\n<p><em>World Wide Web</em> refers to the information on the internet.</p>\n<p><em>Networking</em> is the process of managing, building and designing a network.</p>\n<p><em>IP address</em> is an identifier of a computer on a network.</p>\n<p><em>MAC address</em> is a permanent identifier built into a hardware</p>\n<p><em>Packets</em> are little bits of data.</p>\n<p><em>Router</em> connect lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.</p>\n<p><em>Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)</em> - TCP handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. IP delivers packets to the right computers.</p>\n<p><em>Domain Name System(DNS)</em> - maps a domain name to an IP address.</p>\n<p><em>Network Address Translation</em> - lets an organization use one public IP address and many IP addresses. within a network.</p>\n<h4>Software</h4>\n<p>This is what enable users to interact with a computer.</p>\n<p><em>Coding</em> - translating one language to another.</p>\n<p><em>Scripting</em>- coding in a scripting language.</p>\n<p><em>Application software</em> - software created to fulfill specific need. eg text editor</p>\n<p><em>System software</em> - keeps our core system running eg OS</p>\n<p><em>Firmware software</em> -software that is stored permanently on a computer.</p>\n<p><em>Abstraction</em> is the concept of taking complex system and simplifying it for use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assembly language</li>\n<li>Machine language</li>\n<li>Compiled language</li>\n<li>interpreted language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When troubleshooting in IT ask questions and document your solutions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IT Support","date":"May 20, 2022","description":"what am learning on IT support course"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/shell_scripting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"shell scripting"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"d41c7aa6-4e6d-5328-9915-d948f2821f9a","previousPostId":"b06cfd96-2ab1-5e59-b8a4-82cf49f30cd2","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
