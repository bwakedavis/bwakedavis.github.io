Generate and validate ideas.\nInvolves:\nUser flows - diagrams that outline the steps a user might take during the experience as they go from step to step in the UI.\nWireframes - a rough skeleton representation of the UI and the various components that make up the UI.Templates of each page are sketched.Color schemes are chosen</p>\n<h6>Implementation</h6>\n<p>Prototype - UI designers create a low or high fidelity prototype, which may or may not be interactive.\nFront-end and Back-end development - once the prototype has been approved the developers make the prototype of a working product.</p>\n<h6>Reporting</h6>\n<p>Usability reporting - observing real users using the product through a variety of means.\nSplit testing - testing the effectiveness of one design iteration over another.\nAnalytics reporting - gaining additional insights eg. time spend on pages, bouncing rates</p>\n<h5>Job Responsibilities of a UX designer</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Researching - understand the audience</li>\n<li>Wireframing - outline/ sketching products or screens.</li>\n<li>Prototyping - develop early design of the product that demonstrates functionality.</li>\n<li>Creating information architecture - framework of a website, how it is organized and steructured.</li>\n<li>Communicating effectively</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>UX common terms, tools and frameworks</h4>\n<p><strong>End user</strong>  - is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for.</p>\n<p><strong>user</strong> - refers to any person using the product.</p>\n<p><strong>user -centric design</strong> - putting the user at the front and center.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand</li>\n<li>Specify</li>\n<li>Design</li>\n<li>Evaluate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key UX frameworks:</p>\n<p>A <strong>framework</strong> creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you’re trying to solve.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The five elements of UX design framework.</li>\n<li>\n<p>steps a designer takes to turn an idea into a working product.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>strategy - most abstract</li>\n<li>scope</li>\n<li>structure</li>\n<li>skeleton</li>\n<li>surface - most concrete</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design thinking UX framework.\nA way to create solutions that addresses a real user problems and are functional and affordable.\nsteps</p>\n<ul>\n<li>empathize</li>\n<li>define</li>\n<li>ideate</li>\n<li>prototype</li>\n<li>test</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Equity based design.\nbuild products that meet the needs of specific individuals and groups who have historically been excluded.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Next Billion Issue</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost</li>\n<li>Connectivity</li>\n<li>Digital literacy</li>\n<li>Literacy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Platform</em> is the medium that users experience your product on eg mobile, desktop.</p>\n<p><em>Brand identity</em> is the visual appearance and voice of a company.</p>\n<p>Responsive web design allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device users behave differently depending on their device.</p>\n<p>When designing for different platforms ensure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consistency</li>\n<li>Continuity</li>\n<li>Context</li>\n<li>Complementary</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"user experience(UX) and user interface design(UI)","date":"May 02, 2020","description":"User Experience and User Interface Design are important elements in development of any product"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bitcoin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"learn all things bitcoin"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ethereum/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"understand ethereum and it's wide ecosystem"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dc311c73-7d24-52c3-bc41-18af3caaffa8","previousPostId":"1954bf84-801e-55b4-99d6-425646118b09","nextPostId":"8e502a67-e20d-5465-8b22-b8beeda8b44f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
