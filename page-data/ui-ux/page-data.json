It relies on visual design, behavioral psychology and consumer research.</p>\n<h2>Steps in UX Design</h2>\n<p>Research -> Brainstorming -> Implementation -> Reporting</p>\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<p>Involves:\nUnderstanding - conducting of user interviews to identify the requirements.Understand the problem you’re solving.\nUser personas - representation of a typical user to identify their needs.\nUse cases - how might different people use the product or service.\nJourney maps - how a user might start to use and finish the experience</p>\n<h3>Brainstorming</h3>\n<p>How to solve the problem. Generate and validate ideas.\nInvolves:\nUser flows - diagrams that outline the steps a user might take during the experience as they go from step to step in the UI.\nWireframes - a rough skeleton representation of the UI and the various components that make up the UI.Templates of each page are sketched.Color schemes are chosen</p>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p>Prototype - UI designers create a low or high fidelity prototype, which may or may not be interactive.\nFront-end and Back-end development - once the prototype has been approved the developers make the prototype of a working product.</p>\n<h3>Reporting</h3>\n<p>Usability reporting - observing real users using the product through a variety of means.\nSplit testing - testing the effectiveness of one design iteration over another.\nAnalytics reporting - gaining additional insights eg. time spend on pages, bouncing rates</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"user experience(UX) and user interface design(UI)","date":"May 02, 2020","description":"User Experience and User Interface Design are important elements in development of any product"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ethereum/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"understand ethereum and it's wide ecosystem"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/devops/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"learn devops"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dc311c73-7d24-52c3-bc41-18af3caaffa8","previousPostId":"8e502a67-e20d-5465-8b22-b8beeda8b44f","nextPostId":"bf4a38fa-1f69-5f61-ba7e-1179bccb67a9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
