a fictional one-sentence story told from the personas point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.</p>\n<p>Advantages of user stories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prioritize design goals.</li>\n<li>Inspire empathetic design decisions.</li>\n<li>Unites the team.</li>\n<li>Personalize pitches to stakeholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Edge case</strong> -

a visual prompt that tells the user to take action.</p>\n<p><strong>Serial position effect</strong> - when people are given a list of items, they are more likely to remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur.</p>\n<p><strong>Hicks law</strong> - the more options a user has, the longer it takes them to make a decision.</p>\n<h4>Ideating design solutions</h4>\n<p><em>Ideation</em> is the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic, with no attempt to judge or evaluate them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorm out loud.</li>\n<li>Document all ideas.</li>\n<li>Focus on quantity.</li>\n<li>Do not allow evaluation.</li>\n<li>Gather a diverse team.</li>\n<li>Question the obvious.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Evaluate the ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Feasible</em> -

how human group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Similarity</em> - elements looking similar/have same function.</li>\n<li><em>Proximity</em> - elements close together are more related.</li>\n<li><em>Common region</em> - elemets within same are grouped together.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Prototype</strong> - is an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality.\nIt shows stakeholders and potential users what your design can do.</p>\n<p>The difference between a wireframe and a low fidelity prototype is the ability to click.</p>\n<h5>Benefits of paper prototypes</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Rapid iteration</li>\n<li>Low commmitment</li>\n<li>Encourage honest feedback.</li>\n<li>Collaborative activity</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Deceptive patterns</strong> are UX methods that trick users into doing/buying something they wouldn’t otherwise have done or bought.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Forced continuity</em> - charging for membership without warning and reminder.</li>\n<li><em>Sneak into the basket</em> - adding extra products without concent.</li>\n<li><em>Hidden cost</em> -paying fees you aren’t aware.</li>\n<li><em>Confirm shaming</em> -

a group of slides, where each slide has new information.</p>\n<p><em>Research rapport</em> - a document with fewer visuals, containing the same information as the presentation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know your audience.</li>\n<li>Provide an overview.</li>\n<li>Tell a story</li>\n<li>Show numbers</li>\n<li>Less is more when it comes to text.</li>\n<li>Provide recommendations for next steps.</li>\n<li>Leave time for questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tips</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be concise.</li>\n<li>Keep your tone conversation.</li>\n<li>Use stories.</li>\n<li>Allow pauses.</li>\n<li>Make eye contact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Create High-Fidelity Designs and prototype</h3>\n<p><strong>Visual design</strong> - how a product or technology appear to users.</p>\n<p><strong>Mockup</strong> - a static high fidelity design that represent your final product.</p>\n<p><strong>Fidelity</strong>- how a product design looks, feels like the final product.</p>\n<h5>Foundation elements of visual design</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Typography - use of text and fonts, adds hierachy to your designs, make text easy to read, adds visual style.</li>\n<li><strong>Color</strong> - messages that certain colors communicate, how people understand color, how color mix, match or contrast with one another.</li>\n<li><strong>Iconography</strong> - refers to the images or symbols associated with a subject or idea.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Typographic hierarchy</strong> - a method of ordering typefaces and fonts in a layout to create divisions that show users where to focus and how to find information.</p>\n<p>Importance of color:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add emphasis in your design.</li>\n<li>Communicate branding.</li>\n<li>Impact the accessibility.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Benefits of images:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Communicate a message without using words.</li>\n<li>Create emotional response to users.</li>\n<li>Set a product apart from the competitors. ENhance designs, create connection to the product for users, establish a strong brand presence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An unclutered page is easier to read.</li>\n<li>Meet your expectations.</li>\n<li>Not all links look the same.</li>\n<li>Use descriptive links.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Buttons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make buttons look like buttons.</li>\n<li>Be consistent.</li>\n<li>Include negative space.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Inputs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use visual cues.</li>\n<li>Group inputs using sub-categories.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Layout</strong> - refer to specific placements of text, styles, icons and images.</p>\n<p>Grids to guide layouts:</p>\n<p><strong>Basic grids</strong> - intersecting lines divide pages into small squares that allow you to easily lay out elements in a design.</p>\n<p><strong>Layout grids</strong> - a series of columns and alleys that allow you to organize elements in a design.</p>\n<p>Reasons to use grids:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create clarity and consistency.</li>\n<li>Quicken the design process.</li>\n<li>Make it easier to collaborate on designs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized.</p>\n<p><em>Dividers</em> - lines that separate sections.</p>\n<p><em>Borders</em> - group of lines to break up sections of a page.</p>\n<p><em>Fill</em> - assigns colors to borders and shapes.</p>\n<p><em>Shadow</em> - create dimension in combination with borders or fill.</p>\n<p><strong>Negative(white*) space</strong> - the gaps between elements in a design, often referred to as negative space(line spacing, margins, padding).</p>\n<p>Importance of white space:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide emphasis on a focal point within the design.</li>\n<li>Group items together, which is also known as proximity.</li>\n<li>Gives users a visual break.</li>\n<li>Increases readibility.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Applying visual design principles to mockups</h5>\n<p><strong>Mockups</strong> - something that attracts attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual weight</strong> - a measure of the force that an element exerts to attract the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Contrast</strong> - creation of opposing visual elements to convey emphasis or comparison.</p>\n<p><strong>Texture</strong> - elements within an object that add depth or a pattern to an object.</p>\n<p><strong>Hierachy</strong> - refers to a group of elements that are organized in order of importance.</p>\n<p>Emphasis is about making an element stand out from the other elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Scale</strong> - explains the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design.</p>\n<p><strong>Proportion</strong> - the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"user experience(UX) and user interface design(UI)","date":"May 02, 2020","description":"User Experience and User Interface Design are important elements in development of any product"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bitcoin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"learn all things bitcoin"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ethereum/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"understand ethereum and it's wide ecosystem"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dc311c73-7d24-52c3-bc41-18af3caaffa8","previousPostId":"1954bf84-801e-55b4-99d6-425646118b09","nextPostId":"8e502a67-e20d-5465-8b22-b8beeda8b44f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
