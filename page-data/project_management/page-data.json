Used when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, when project changes are expensive to implement once it’s started, when phases of the project are clearly defined.</p>\n<p><strong>Agile</strong> - Ability to move quickly and easily, willing to change and adopt, done in pieces. Adopt iterative approach, the phases overlap and the tasks are completed in iterations, which in scrum are called sprints.</p>\n<p><strong>Lean and Sigma</strong> - Save money, Improve, quality, Move quickly through processes, Team Collaboration, Positive work environment.\nDefine, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control(DMAIC)</p>\n<p><strong>Kanban</strong> -An agile approach and a tool that provides a visual feedback about status of the work in progress through the use of kanban boards/chats.</p>\n<h5>Organizational structure and culture</h5>\n<p>Organizational structure is the way a company or organization is arranged.</p>\n<p>Types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Matrix</em> - Has direct higher ups and stakeholders from other departments/programs.</li>\n<li><em>Classic</em> - functional/top-down structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Resource availability - knowing how to access the people, equipment and budget needed for a project.</p>\n<p><em>Functions of a project management office</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategic planning and governance.</li>\n<li>Best practices.</li>\n<li>Common project culture.</li>\n<li>Resource management.</li>\n<li>Creation of project documentation, archives and</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Organizational culture</em> refers to the values employees share as well as the organizations values, mission and history.</p>\n<p><em>Change Management</em> is the process of delivering  your completed project and getting people to adopt it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>creating a sense of ownership and urgency.</li>\n<li>Figure out the right combination of skills and personalities</li>\n<li>Effective communication - transparency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Project Initiation: Starting a successful project</h3>\n<p>Initiate a project</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the project scope, goals, and deliverables.</li>\n<li>Identify the project stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Scoping project tools and resources.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Initiation</h4>\n<p>Begin after a problem or opportunity has been identified.</p>\n<p>Research, determine resources, determine key components , understand expectations.</p>\n<p><em>Cost Benefit Analysis</em> - the process of adding up the expected value of a project. The benefits and comparing them to the dollar costs.</p>\n<h5>Benefits of determination</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>What value will this project create?</li>\n<li>How much money could this project save?</li>\n<li>How much money will it bring in from existing customers?</li>\n<li>How much time will be saved?</li>\n<li>How will the user experience be improved?</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Cost determination</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>How much time will the project take?</li>\n<li>What will be the one time cost?</li>\n<li>Are there any ongoing costs?</li>\n<li>What about long term costs?</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Components of Initiation</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Goals - what you have asked to do, what you’re trying to achieve.</li>\n<li>Scope - is the process to define the work that need to be done in order to complete the project.</li>\n<li>Project deliverables - products and services that will you create for your customers, clients or project sponsors.</li>\n<li>Success criteria - is the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching it’s goals.</li>\n<li>Stakeholders - people who both have interest in, and are affected by the completion and success of a project(Understand their need early on).</li>\n<li>Resources - budget, people and materials needed.</li>\n<li>Create a project charter</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A <strong>project charter</strong> is a document that clearly defines  the project and it’s goals, and outlines what is needed to accomplish them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure everyone is aligned before planning and then execution.</li>\n<li>Meet with the stakeholders and understand expectations</li>\n<li>ROI(Return of Investment)</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h5>\n<p>Intangible benefits</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer satisfaction</li>\n<li>Employee satisfaction</li>\n<li>Employee productivity</li>\n<li>Brand perception</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>(G - C) / C = ROI</strong></p>\n<p>where <strong>G</strong> - Gains, and <strong>C</strong> = Upfront Cost</p>\n<h4>Define project goals, scope and success criteria</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Define and create project goals and deliverables.</li>\n<li>Define project scope, what is considered in-scope, out-of-scope and scope recap.</li>\n<li>Explain how to define and measure a project success criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Determining project goals and deliverables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Project goal</em> is the desired outcome of the project(what you have been asked to de or what you are trying to achieve).</li>\n<li><em>Project deliverables</em> are products/services that are created for the customer, client or project sponsor. What gets produced from the project at the end of the project report. A deliverable helps quantify and realize the impact of the project.</li>\n<li>Meet with stakeholders and refine goals.</li>\n<li>Assess stakeholders power and influence on the project.</li>\n<li>Assign roles and responsibilities to promote the service.</li>\n<li>Create a charter for the next stage of the project.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goals should be well defined and SMART:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific - what do I want to accomplish?, why is this a goal?, who is involved?, where is the goal to be delivered?, what is the degree?</li>\n<li>Measurable - how much?, how many?, how will I know it’s accomplished?(Use metrics, benchmark point of reference)</li>\n<li>Attainable - can it be reasonably reached?, how can it be accomplished?</li>\n<li>Relevant - does it make sense?, is the goal worthwhile?, is it the right time?</li>\n<li>Time-bound - deadline and clear time frame</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Introduction to Objective and Key results(OKR’s)</h5>\n<p>Help in establishing and clarifying goals or objectives. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.</p>\n<p><em>Objective</em> defines what needs to be achieved, describe the desired outcome. eg. Increase customer retention.</p>\n<p><em>Key results</em> - measurable outcomes that define when the objective have been met. eg. Achieve 90% customer satisfaction by the end of the year, stretch goals(ambitions).</p>\n<h5>Project scope</h5>\n<p>Boundary of a project.What is included and excluded.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who will be using the product</li>\n<li>Timeline, budget, resources.</li>\n<li>Talk to sponsors and stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Why is this project needed?</li>\n<li>Where did the project come from?</li>\n<li>What is it expected to achieve?</li>\n<li>What does the sponsors have in mind?</li>\n<li>Who approves the final result?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>scope creep</em> - changes, growth an uncontrolled factors that affect a projects scope at any point after the project begins.</p>\n<p>Sources of scope creep can be <em>internal</em> or <em>external</em>.</p>\n<p>solutions to scope creep include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow visibility</li>\n<li>Get clarity of requirements.</li>\n<li>Set ground rules and expectations.</li>\n<li>Create a plan on how to deal with out-of -scope requests.</li>\n<li>Have requirements and rules written.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Triple constrains model</p>\n<p><strong>Scope + Cost + Time = Quality</strong></p>\n<p><em>Launch</em> -
