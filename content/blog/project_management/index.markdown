#### Project development lifecycle

1. Initiate the project
2. Make a plan

+ Create a budget
+ Set the schedule.
+ Establish your team.'
+ Determine roles and responsibilities.

A **retrospective** is a chance  to note best practices and learn how to manage a project more effectively the next time.

#### Project management methodology

Is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project trough it's lifecycle.

+ *Linear* means the previous phase/ task has to be completed before the next can start. eg building a house.
+ *Iterative* means that some phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on.

**Waterfall model** - Each task are completed sequentially. Used when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, when project changes are expensive to implement once it's started, when phases of the project are clearly defined.

**Agile** - Ability to move quickly and easily, willing to change and adopt, done in pieces. Adopt iterative approach, the phases overlap and the tasks are completed in iterations, which in scrum are called sprints.

**Lean and Sigma** - Save money, Improve, quality, Move quickly through processes, Team Collaboration, Positive work environment.
Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control(DMAIC)

**Kanban** -An agile approach and a tool that provides a visual feedback about status of the work in progress through the use of kanban boards/chats.

##### Organizational structure and culture

Organizational structure is the way a company or organization is arranged.

Types include:
+ *Matrix* - Has direct higher ups and stakeholders from other departments/programs.

+ creating a sense of ownership and urgency.
+ Figure out the right combination of skills and personalities
+ Effective communication - transparency.

### 2. Project Initiation: Starting a successful project

Initiate a project

1. Identify the project scope, goals, and deliverables.
2. Identify the project stakeholders.
3. Scoping project tools and resources.

#### Initiation

Begin after a problem or opportunity has been identified.

Research, determine resources, determine key components , understand expectations.

*Cost Benefit Analysis* - the process of adding up the expected value of a project. The benefits and comparing them to the dollar costs.

##### Benefits of determination

+ What value will this project create?
+ How much money could this project save?
+ How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
+ How much time will be saved?
+ How will the user experience be improved?

##### Cost determination

+ How much time will the project take?
+ What will be the one time cost?
+ Are there any ongoing costs?
+ What about long term costs?

##### Components of Initiation

1. Goals - what you have asked to do, what you're trying to achieve.
2. Scope - is the process to define the work that need to be done in order to complete the project.
3. Project deliverables - products and services that will you create for your customers, clients or project sponsors.
4. Success criteria - is the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching it's goals.
5. Stakeholders - people who both have interest in, and are affected by the completion and success of a project(Understand their need early on).
6. Resources - budget, people and materials needed.

+ Create a project charter

A **project charter** is a document that clearly defines  the project and it's goals, and outlines what is needed to accomplish them.

+ Ensure everyone is aligned before planning and then execution.
+ Meet with the stakeholders and understand expectations
+ ROI(Return of Investment)

##### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Intangible benefits

1. Customer satisfaction
2. Employee satisfaction
3. Employee productivity
4. Brand perception

**(G - C) / C = ROI**

where **G** - Gains, and **C** = Upfront Cost

#### Define project goals, scope and success criteria

+ Define and create project goals and deliverables.
+ Define project scope, what is considered in-scope, out-of-scope and scope recap.
+ Explain how to define and measure a project success criteria.

Determining project goals and deliverables:

+ *Project goal* is the desired outcome of the project(what you have been asked to de or what you are trying to achieve).
+ *Project deliverables* are products/services that are created for the customer, client or project sponsor. What gets produced from the project at the end of the project report. A deliverable helps quantify and realize the impact of the project.
+ Meet with stakeholders and refine goals.
+ Assess stakeholders power and influence on the project.
+ Assign roles and responsibilities to promote the service.
+ Create a charter for the next stage of the project.
+ Goals should be well defined and SMART:
    + Specific - what do I want to accomplish?, why is this a goal?, who is involved?, where is the goal to be delivered?, what is the degree?
    + Measurable - how much?, how many?, how will I know it's accomplished?(Use metrics, benchmark point of reference)
    + Attainable - can it be reasonably reached?, how can it be accomplished?
    + Relevant - does it make sense?, is the goal worthwhile?, is it the right time?
    + Time-bound - deadline and clear time frame

##### Introduction to Objective and Key results(OKR's)

Help in establishing and clarifying goals or objectives. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.

*Objective* defines what needs to be achieved, describe the desired outcome. eg. Increase customer retention.

*Key results* - measurable outcomes that define when the objective have been met. eg. Achieve 90% customer satisfaction by the end of the year, stretch goals(ambitions).

##### Project scope

Boundary of a project.What is included and excluded.
+ Who will be using the product
+ Timeline, budget, resources.
+ Talk to sponsors and stakeholders.
+ Why is this project needed?
+ Where did the project come from?
+ What is it expected to achieve?
+ What does the sponsors have in mind?
+ Who approves the final result?

*scope creep* - changes, growth an uncontrolled factors that affect a projects scope at any point after the project begins.

Sources of scope creep can be *internal* or *external*.

solutions to scope creep include:
+ Allow visibility
+ Get clarity of requirements.
+ Set ground rules and expectations.
+ Create a plan on how to deal with out-of -scope requests.
+ Have requirements and rules written.

Triple constrains model

**Scope + Cost + Time = Quality**

*Launch* - refers to delivering the final result of your project to the client/ user.

*Landing* - refers to measuring success of your product using the success criteria established at the outset of the project.

##### Success criteria

Include specific details of goals and deliverables

Tells you whether or not the project was successful.

Are standards by which the project could be judged once it's been delivered to stakeholders.

+ Identify the measurable aspects of the project
+ Get clarity from stakeholders eg. on project requirements and expectations.
+ Engagement - how often or meaningful customer interaction and participation over time
+ Adoption

#### Working with stakeholders

**Accessibility** is the process of actively removing any barriers that might prevent persons with disabilities from being able to access technology,information, experiences and leveling the playing field so everyone has an equal chance of enjoying life and being successful.

+ List of required roles
+ Team size
+ Necessary skills, motivation and availability.

##### Defining project roles

+ *Project sponsor* - the person who is accountable for the project and ensures the project delivers the agreed upon business benefit.
+ *Team members* - the people doing the  work and making things happen.
+ *Customers* - the people who will get some value from a successfully landed project.
+ *Users* - the people who will use the product produced by the project.
+ *Stakeholders* -anyone involved in the project, has vested interest in the project success.
+ *Project manager* - the person who plans, organizes and oversees the whole project.

##### Evaluating stakeholders

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders and how they impact the project.
2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder.(How much are the needs of the stakeholders affected by the project operations and outcomes).
3. Assess stakeholders ability to participate and then find ways to involve them.
(Influence measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much this stakeholder action affects the project outcome)

(Interest + Influence)

+ (High Power + High Interest) - Key players.
+ (High Power + Low Interest) - Meet their needs.
+ (Low Power + High Interest) - Show consideration.
+ (Low Power +Low Interest) - Monitor(minimum effort).

*Stakeholder buy-in* - involving them in decision making.

##### RACI chart

A *RACI chart* helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently.

+ *Responsible* - those doing the work
+ *Accountable* - those making sure the work gets done.
+ *Consulted* - those giving feedback, like subject mater experts/ decision makers.
+ *Informed* - those just needing to know the final decisions, or that the task is complete.

##### Project Initiation missteps

+ What are the project goals.
+ What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project stakeholders.
+ What resources do they need to complete their work.

Types of project documentation:
1. **Project Proposal** - A form of documentation that persuades a stakeholder to begin a project. It's created by seniors mostly.
2. **Project Charter** - A formal document that that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details needed to reach it's goals.
    + helps you get organized
    + makes clear that the benefits of the project outweighs the cost of the project.
    + help ensure that you and your stakeholders agree on the details of the project.
