## UI Design

UI design is the designing of visual interface of a software.
I the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.
It's the point of interaction between the user and the digital product
Good design makes something intelligent, memorable and meaningful.
A design language is a set of consistent visual element that can be reused.

### Principles of UI design

+ White Space - the amount empty space between elements.
+ Color - use 4 or 5 colors(recommended).
+ Contrast - being 'strikingly' different from something else.
+ Scale - consider the size of the element.
+ Alignment - the process of  ensuring every element is positioned correctly in relation to each other.
+ Typography
+ Visual Hierarchy

### Stages of UI design

+ Rough sketches
+ Block design
+ Wire frame
+ Mockup ui
+ Prototype

### Tips to make a great design

+ Emphasis and importance
+ Make everything the user needs readily accessible.
+ Be consistent and mobile friendly
+ Contrast and readability
+ Be clear by splitting steps into different pages.
+ Give Feedback to the user eg "form submitted"
+ Proximity and layout
+ Use recognition by using most used icons that users can easily identify.
+ Follow design standards.
+ Borders and spacing
+ Keep things stupid simple.
+ Fill and corners
+ keep relevant items eg.buttons together
+ Test your designs

# UX Design

UX mostly focuses on usability, problems and accessibility.
It involves interactions between the potential or active user of a product. It relies on visual design, behavioral psychology and consumer research.

## Steps in UX Design

Research -> Brainstorming -> Implementation -> Reporting

### Research

Involves:
Understanding - conducting of user interviews to identify the requirements.Understand the problem you're solving.
User personas - representation of a typical user to identify their needs.
Use cases - how might different people use the product or service.
Journey maps - how a user might start to use and finish the experience

### Brainstorming

How to solve the problem. Generate and validate ideas.
Involves:
User flows - diagrams that outline the steps a user might take during the experience as they go from step to step in the UI.
Wireframes - a rough skeleton representation of the UI and the various components that make up the UI.Templates of each page are sketched.Color schemes are chosen

### Implementation

Prototype - UI designers create a low or high fidelity prototype, which may or may not be interactive.
Front-end and Back-end development - once the prototype has been approved the developers make the prototype of a working product.

### Reporting

Usability reporting - observing real users using the product through a variety of means.
Split testing - testing the effectiveness of one design iteration over another.
Analytics reporting - gaining additional insights eg. time spend on pages, bouncing rates
