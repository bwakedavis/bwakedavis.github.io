## UI Design

UI design is the designing of visual interface of a software.
I the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.
It's the point of interaction between the user and the digital product
Good design makes something intelligent, memorable and meaningful.
A design language is a set of consistent visual element that can be reused.

### Principles of UI design

+ White Space - the amount empty space between elements.
+ Color - use 4 or 5 colors(recommended).
+ Contrast - being 'strikingly' different from something else.
+ Scale - consider the size of the element.
+ Alignment - the process of  ensuring every element is positioned correctly in relation to each other.
+ Typography
+ Visual Hierarchy

### Stages of UI design

+ Rough sketches
+ Block design
+ Wire frame
+ Mockup ui
+ Prototype

### Foundations of User Experience Design

#### Introduction

**User Experience Design** focus on the experience that the users have while using a product like websites, apps and physical objects.

UX mostly focuses on usability, problems and accessibility.
It involves interactions between the potential or active user of a product. It relies on visual design, behavioral psychology and consumer research.

Tools - figma, adobe xd

A good design should be:
+ usable
+ equitable - accessible to all
+ enjoyable
+ useful - give value to users.

Tips to make a great design:
+ Emphasis and importance
+ Make everything the user needs readily accessible.
+ Be consistent and mobile friendly
+ Contrast and readability
+ Be clear by splitting steps into different pages.
+ Give Feedback to the user eg "form submitted"
+ Proximity and layout
+ Use recognition by using most used icons that users can easily identify.
+ Follow design standards.
+ Borders and spacing
+ Keep things stupid simple.
+ Fill and corners
+ keep relevant items eg.buttons together
+ Test your designs

A UX designer can do:
+ user research
+ branding
+ user flows
+ UX writing
+ visual design
+ prototyping
+ product design
+ information architecture
+ usability testing.

**User experience** is how a person , the user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

A **product** is a good, service or a feature.

A UX designer is:
+ *Curious*- try to understand people and how their minds work.
+ *Empathetic* - ability to understand someone's feeling or thought situation.

##### Types and colleagues of UX designers

1. *Interaction Designer* - focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
2. *Visual Designer* - focus on how a product or technology looks. eg ui, fonts, logo.
3. *Motion Designer*  - thinks on how it feels like for a user to move through a product. ie transition.
4. Graphic Designer - focus on the physical appearance of of the product.
5. *UX Researcher* - conduct studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.
6. *UX Writers* - think about how to make the language within a product clearer.
7. *Production designer* - works as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.
8. *UX engineer* - translate the design intent into functioning experience.
9. *UX Program Manager* - ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.

Assets - text, images, design, specification, font style, color, size , spacing, etc.

##### Product Development Cycle

Refers to the process used to take a product from an idea to product.

Stages:
1. *Brainstorm* - research to understand user problem.
2. *Define* - using the insights from the brainstorming stage and starting to narrow the focus.
3. *Design* - implementing insights into new designs using various tools ie. create assets, storyboards, sketches, prototypes.
4. *Test* - Evaluating the product design based on feedback from potential users.
5. *Launch* - sharing the finished version of the design with the public


Research -> Brainstorming -> Implementation -> Reporting

###### Research

Involves:
Understanding - conducting of user interviews to identify the requirements.Understand the problem you're solving.
User personas - representation of a typical user to identify their needs.
Use cases - how might different people use the product or service.
Journey maps - how a user might start to use and finish the experience

###### Brainstorming

How to solve the problem. Generate and validate ideas.
Involves:
User flows - diagrams that outline the steps a user might take during the experience as they go from step to step in the UI.
Wireframes - a rough skeleton representation of the UI and the various components that make up the UI.Templates of each page are sketched.Color schemes are chosen

###### Implementation

Prototype - UI designers create a low or high fidelity prototype, which may or may not be interactive.
Front-end and Back-end development - once the prototype has been approved the developers make the prototype of a working product.

###### Reporting

Usability reporting - observing real users using the product through a variety of means.
Split testing - testing the effectiveness of one design iteration over another.
Analytics reporting - gaining additional insights eg. time spend on pages, bouncing rates

##### Job Responsibilities of a UX designer
1. Researching - understand the audience
2. Wireframing - outline/ sketching products or screens.
3. Prototyping - develop early design of the product that demonstrates functionality.
4. Creating information architecture - framework of a website, how it is organized and structured.
5. Communicating effectively

#### UX common terms, tools and frameworks

**End user**  - is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for.

**user** - refers to any person using the product.

**user -centric design** - putting the user at the front and center.

+ Understand
+ Specify
+ Design
+ Evaluate.

Key UX frameworks:

A **framework** creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve.
1. The five elements of UX design framework.
- steps a designer takes to turn an idea into a working product.
    + strategy - most abstract
    + scope
    + structure
    + skeleton
    + surface - most concrete
2. Design thinking UX framework.
A way to create solutions that addresses a real user problems and are functional and affordable.
steps
    + empathize
    + define
    + ideate
    + prototype
    + test
3. Equity based design.
build products that meet the needs of specific individuals and groups who have historically been excluded.

*Next Billion Issue*
+ Cost
+ Connectivity
+ Digital literacy
+ Literacy

*Platform* is the medium that users experience your product on eg mobile, desktop.

*Brand identity* is the visual appearance and voice of a company.

Responsive web design allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device users behave differently depending on their device.

When designing for different platforms ensure:
+ Consistency
+ Continuity
+ Context
+ Complementary

**Universal design** is the process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations.

**Inclusive design** - making design choices that take into account persoanl identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, race.

*Accessibility* - the design of products, design, services or environments for the people with disabilities.

**Equity-focused design** - design for groups that have historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.

*Equality* - providing the same amount of opportunity and support.

*Equity* - providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes. (better equality)

*Social model of disability* - defines a disability as being caused by the way society is organized of how products are designed, rather than a person's ability or difference.

**Assistive technology** -Any products, equipment and systems that enhance learning, working and daily living for people with disabilities.

#### Joining design sprints

**Design sprint** - Is a time-bound process, with five phases typically spread over 5 full days.
The goal of a design sprint is to solve a problem through designing, prototyping and testing ideas with the users.

##### Phases

1. Understand - understand the dewsign challenges.
2. Ideate - plan for user testing, expert ideas.
3. Decide - decide the solution to go with.
4. Prototype - get a working prototype.
5. Test - observe and interview user for experience.

Benefits of design sprint:
1. Save time
2. Create a path to bring a product to market.
3. Prioritize the user.
4. Test product before launch.
5. It's all about the user
6. Value every person in the room.
7. The best ideas rise to the top.
8. Lower risks

When to sprint:
1. Many potential solutions to challenge?
2. Cross-functional teams needed to weigh in?
3. Challenge a scope wide enough.

##### Plan design sprints

1. User research.
2. Call in the experts.
3. Find the right space.
4. Gather supplies.
5. Establish rules for the sprint
6. Plan introductions
7. Post-sprint plannign, documentation.

**Sprint brief** - A document that you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint.
1. Sprint challenge
2. Key deliverables
3. Logistics
4. Approvers
5. Resources

*Sprint leader* - is the person who sends out the sprint brief to the team.

### Starting research into the design process

#### Intergrating research into the design process

+ Empathiize with users
+ Build an empathy map
+ Understand user pain points
+ Explore personas
+ Write user stories
+ Identify happy paths and edge cases
+ Discover the benefits of user journey maps.
+ Write problem statements and hypothesis statements.
+ Consider accesibility.

**UX Research** - focuses on understanding user behaviour, needs, and motivation through observation and feedback.

**Product development lifecycle** is the process used to take a product from an idea to reality.

A UX Researcher has:
1. *Empathy* - ability to understand someone's else feelings or thought in a situation.
2. *Pragmatism* - focused on reaching goals
3. *Collaboration* - can work with a range of people personalities and work styles.

*Foundational research* - done before you start designing.

**Bias** - is favouring or having prejudices against something based on limited information.

#### Kinds of UX Biases

1. *Confirmation bias* - occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have.
2. *False consensus bias* - overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design.
3. *Primary bias* -remember the first participant most strongly.
4. *Implicit bias* - the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious.
5. *Sunk cost fallacy* -the deeper we get into a project, we're invested in, the harder it is to change course.
6. *Recency bias* - remember the last participant most strongly.

*Screener survey* - a detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet requirements of the research study.

*Representative sample* - a subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group.

##### Prepare for user interviews

1. Script interview questions.
2. Collect supplies.
3. research the users.
4. Practice.

##### Conduct user interviews

1. Meet the participant - build a good rapport, thank the participant for coming, review legal details, gather base details.
2. Conduct the interview - follow  interview etiquette, ask open ended questions.
3. Take notes.
4. Wrap up the interview.

**Empathy map** - an easily understood chart that explains everything designers have learned about a type of user. What tghe users says, thinks, feels, and does.

Aggregated empathy maps represent a visualization of everything designers know about an entire user segment or group of similar users.

*Pain points* are any issues that frustrates the user and block the user from getting what they need.

##### Types of pain points

1. Financial
2. Product
3. Process
4. Support

**Personas** - fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of user personas are built based on research. They help build empathy, tell stories.

**User groups** - a set of people who have similar interests, goals, and concerns.

#### Creating user stories and user journey maps

**User story** - a fictional one-sentence story told from the personas point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.

Advantages of user stories:
1. Prioritize design goals.
2. Inspire empathetic design decisions.
3. Unites the team.
4. Personalize pitches to stakeholders.

**Edge case** - a rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience.

Spotting and resolving edge cases:
1. Create personas and user stories.
2. Thoroughly review the project before launch.
3. User wireframes.

**User journey** - the series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal.

**User journey map** - an illustration of what a user goes through to achieve their goals.
