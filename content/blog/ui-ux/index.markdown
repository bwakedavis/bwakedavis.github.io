## UI Design

UI design is the designing of visual interface of a software.
I the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.
It's the point of interaction between the user and the digital product
Good design makes something intelligent, memorable and meaningful.
A design language is a set of consistent visual element that can be reused.

### Principles of UI design

+ White Space - the amount empty space between elements.
+ Color - use 4 or 5 colors(recommended).
+ Contrast - being 'strikingly' different from something else.
+ Scale - consider the size of the element.
+ Alignment - the process of  ensuring every element is positioned correctly in relation to each other.
+ Typography
+ Visual Hierarchy

### Stages of UI design

+ Rough sketches
+ Block design
+ Wire frame
+ Mockup ui
+ Prototype

1. Foundations of User Experience design
2. Start the UX Design process: Empathize, Define and Ideate
3. Build wireframes and Low-fidelity prototypes.
4. Conduct UX research and test Early concepts.
5. Create High-Fidelity Designs and prototypes in figma.
6. Responsive web design in Adobe XD.

### Foundations of User Experience Design

#### Introduction

**User Experience Design** focus on the experience that the users have while using a product like websites, apps and physical objects.

UX mostly focuses on usability, problems and accessibility.
It involves interactions between the potential or active user of a product. It relies on visual design, behavioral psychology and consumer research.

Tools - figma, adobe xd

A good design should be:
+ usable
+ equitable - accessible to all
+ enjoyable
+ useful - give value to users.

Tips to make a great design:
+ Emphasis and importance
+ Make everything the user needs readily accessible.
+ Be consistent and mobile friendly
+ Contrast and readability
+ Be clear by splitting steps into different pages.
+ Give Feedback to the user eg "form submitted"
+ Proximity and layout
+ Use recognition by using most used icons that users can easily identify.
+ Follow design standards.
+ Borders and spacing
+ Keep things stupid simple.
+ Fill and corners
+ keep relevant items eg.buttons together
+ Test your designs

A UX designer can do:
+ user research
+ branding
+ user flows
+ UX writing
+ visual design
+ prototyping
+ product design
+ information architecture
+ usability testing.

**User experience** is how a person , the user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

A **product** is a good, service or a feature.

A UX designer is:
+ *Curious*- try to understand people and how their minds work.
+ *Empathetic* - ability to understand someone's feeling or thought situation.

##### Types and colleagues of UX designers

1. *Interaction Designer* - focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
2. *Visual Designer* - focus on how a product or technology looks. eg ui, fonts, logo.
3. *Motion Designer*  - thinks on how it feels like for a user to move through a product. ie transition.
4. Graphic Designer - focus on the physical appearance of of the product.
5. *UX Researcher* - conduct studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.
6. *UX Writers* - think about how to make the language within a product clearer.
7. *Production designer* - works as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.
8. *UX engineer* - translate the design intent into functioning experience.
9. *UX Program Manager* - ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.

Assets - text, images, design, specification, font style, color, size , spacing, etc.

##### Product Development Cycle

Refers to the process used to take a product from an idea to product.

Stages:
1. *Brainstorm* - research to understand user problem.
2. *Define* - using the insights from the brainstorming stage and starting to narrow the focus.
3. *Design* - implementing insights into new designs using various tools ie. create assets, storyboards, sketches, prototypes.
4. *Test* - Evaluating the product design based on feedback from potential users.
5. *Launch* - sharing the finished version of the design with the public


Research -> Brainstorming -> Implementation -> Reporting

###### Research

Involves:
Understanding - conducting of user interviews to identify the requirements.Understand the problem you're solving.
User personas - representation of a typical user to identify their needs.
Use cases - how might different people use the product or service.
Journey maps - how a user might start to use and finish the experience

###### Brainstorming

How to solve the problem. Generate and validate ideas.
Involves:
User flows - diagrams that outline the steps a user might take during the experience as they go from step to step in the UI.
Wireframes - a rough skeleton representation of the UI and the various components that make up the UI.Templates of each page are sketched.Color schemes are chosen

###### Implementation

Prototype - UI designers create a low or high fidelity prototype, which may or may not be interactive.
Front-end and Back-end development - once the prototype has been approved the developers make the prototype of a working product.

###### Reporting

Usability reporting - observing real users using the product through a variety of means.
Split testing - testing the effectiveness of one design iteration over another.
Analytics reporting - gaining additional insights eg. time spend on pages, bouncing rates

##### Job Responsibilities of a UX designer
1. Researching - understand the audience
2. Wireframing - outline/ sketching products or screens.
3. Prototyping - develop early design of the product that demonstrates functionality.
4. Creating information architecture - framework of a website, how it is organized and steructured.
5. Communicating effectively

#### UX common terms, tools and frameworks

**End user**  - is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for.

**user** - refers to any person using the product.

**user -centric design** - putting the user at the front and center.

+ Understand
+ Specify
+ Design
+ Evaluate.

Key UX frameworks:

A **framework** creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve.
1. The five elements of UX design framework.
- steps a designer takes to turn an idea into a working product.
    + strategy - most abstract
    + scope
    + structure
    + skeleton
    + surface - most concrete
2. Design thinking UX framework.
A way to create solutions that addresses a real user problems and are functional and affordable.
steps
    + empathize
    + define
    + ideate
    + prototype
    + test
3. Equity based design.
build products that meet the needs of specific individuals and groups who have historically been excluded.

*Next Billion Issue*
+ Cost
+ Connectivity
+ Digital literacy
+ Literacy

*Platform* is the medium that users experience your product on eg mobile, desktop.

*Brand identity* is the visual appearance and voice of a company.

Responsive web design allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device users behave differently depending on their device.

When designing for different platforms ensure:
+ Consistency
+ Continuity
+ Context
+ Complementary
