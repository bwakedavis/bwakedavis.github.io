### Technical support Fundamentals

#### Introduction

**Information Technology** is the use of digital technology, like computers and the internet to process data into useful information.

Mainly IT roles  involves:
+ Managing
+ Installing
+ Maintaining
+ Troubleshooting and configuring office and computing equipment.

**character encoding** is used to assign  binary values to characters so that humans can read it.
eg. ASCII encoding

**UTF-8** allows us to store a character in more than one byte.

**Algorithm** A series of steps to solve a particular problem.

**Logic gates** Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.

Computer Architecture consist of:
+ Hardware - physical components
+ Operating System - Allows hardware components to connect with the system
+ Software Layer - programs
+ User - operate, maintain and program

#### Hardware

**Ports** are connection points that we can connect to the devices so that we extend the functionality of our computer.
eg. Power outlet, monitor, mouse, keyboard, ethernet

+ **CPU(Central Processing Unit)** - the brain of the computer. Does all the calculations and data processing.
+ **RAM(Random Access Memory)** -temporary memory for the computer.
+ **Harddrive** - holds all our data, eg music, pictures, etc.
+ **Motherboard** - the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.
+ Power supply

*Programs* - are instructions that tells the computer what to do.

*Transistor* send voltage

*Registers* store the data that our cpu works with.

*Memory Controller Chip* is a bridge between the CPU and RAM.

*EDB(External Data bus)*

*Address bus* connects the CPU to the Memory Controller Chip.

*Cache* allows quicker access of data by the CPU. there are levels of cache:
+ L1 is the smallest and the fastest cache
+ L2
+ L3

*Clock wire* lets the cpu know it can start doing calculations.

*Clock speed* is the maximum number of clock cycles  that a cpu can handle in a certain amount of time

*Overclocking* refers to the process of increasing the rate of your cpu clock cycles to perform more tasks.

Types of CPU socket includes:
+ Land Grid Array(LGA)
+ Pin Grid Array(PGA)

*Heat Sync* is used for cooling

Types of RAM includes:
+ *DRAM(Dynamic Random Access Memory)* - when 1 or 0 is send to the DRAM it stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor. This is either a charge or discharge represented by 0 or 1.
+ synchronous DRAM memory
+ SDRAM
+ DDR4

It's important to make sure your RAM is compatible with your motherboard.

*Characteristics of a motherboard*
+ Chipset  which decide how components talk to each other. ie. North bridge(Interconnect things like RAM and video cards), South bridge(maintain IO devices)
+ Expansion slots - gives the ability to increase functionality of our computer.
+ Form factor.

*System on a chip(SOC)* - packs the CPU, RAM and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip. eg on mobile devices.

A *charge cycle* is one full charge and discharge.

*Peripheral* is basically anything that you can connect to your computer externally that adds functionality.'

*USB* - Universal Serial Port.

*MB* is megabyte or unit of data storage.

*Mb/s* is megabit per second which is a unit of data transfer rate.

*Display port* outputs video and audio.

*USB type C* transport data and power.

*VGA, HDMI, DVI, Display Port* can connect a projector to a computer.

**BIOS** - is stored on the motherboard in a readonly memory chip(ROM chip) which is non-volatile.

*UEFI(Unified extensible Firmware Interface)* is more modern and has better compatibility with than BIOS.

*CMOS battery* store basic data used when booting a computer.

#### Operating System

*Operating System* is the whole package that manages our computer resources and let's interact with it. consist of user space(Applications), Kernel space(Process, memory, file, I/O managers).

##### File system

File handling - file data, file metadata and file system. 
+ File system include ext4, NTFS
+ File data - Block storage improves faster handling of data because data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
+ File metadata - owner, permissions, size, date modified, file type.

##### Process management

+ Kernel manage resources efficiently..
+ Multiple processes run at the same time.

The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them and manages how the processes are terminated.

##### Memory management

Memory is managed efficiently.

*Virtual memory* is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that act like memory that our processes can use.

##### I/O management

The kernel manage IO devices by loading drivers that are used, transfer data in and out , how the devices talk to each other.

*Shell* is a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.

*Logs* are files that record system events on our computer, just like a system's diary.

*SSH(Secure Shell)* is a protocol implemented by other programs to securely access one computer from another. You can use SSH client or server.

*Virtual Private Network(VPN)* allows you to connect to a private network over the internet.

#### Networking

A *network* is an interconnection of computers.

*Internet* is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world.

*World Wide Web* refers to the information on the internet.

*Networking* is the process of managing, building and designing a network.

*IP address* is an identifier of a computer on a network.

*MAC address* is a permanent identifier built into a hardware

*Packets* are little bits of data.

*Router* connect lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.

*Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)* - TCP handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. IP delivers packets to the right computers.

*Domain Name System(DNS)* - maps a domain name to an IP address.

*Network Address Translation* - lets an organization use one public IP address and many IP addresses. within a network.

#### Software

This is what enable users to interact with a computer.

*Coding* - translating one language to another.

*Scripting*- coding in a scripting language.

*Application software* - software created to fulfill specific need. eg text editor

*System software* - keeps our core system running eg OS

*Firmware software* -software that is stored permanently on a computer.

*Abstraction* is the concept of taking complex system and simplifying it for use.

+ Assembly language
+ Machine language
+ Compiled language
+ interpreted language

When troubleshooting in IT ask questions and document your solutions.
