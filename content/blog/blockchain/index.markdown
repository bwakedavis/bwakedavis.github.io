A **Blockchain** is a public electronic ledger built around a P2P system that can be openly shared among disparate users to create an unchangeable record of transactions, each time-stamped and linked to the previous one.
Each digital record or transaction in the electronic ledger is called a *block*.
Transactions are protected by strong cryptographic algorithms.
Every new record is validated across the distributed network before it's stored in a block.
To access the data of the *genesis* block you have to traverse to the first block.

### Types of Blockchains
+ *Public*
+ *Private*
+ *Consortium*

### Properties of a Blockchain

+ *Distributed* - all participants in the network have a copy of the ledger.
+ *Secure* -  All records are individually recorded.
+ *Anonymous* - An identity of the participants is either anonymous or pseudonymous.
+ *Timestamped* - when a transaction occurs it's timestamp is recorded on the block.
+ *Immutable* - all validated transaction records are irreversible and cannot be changed.
+ *Programmable* - a blockchain is programmable eg. using smart contracts.
+ *Unanimous* - all network partcipants agree to the validity of each record.

### Benefits of Blockchain

+ Realtime settlement.
+ A lot of money is saved as intermediaries are removed.
+ Good security and reliance.
+ Immutability
+ Anonymity
  
### Blockchain Bullshit

+ Blockchain is free
+ Blockchain is great for storing data
+ Blockchain can be used for everything
+ Blockchain is only for cryptocurrencies
